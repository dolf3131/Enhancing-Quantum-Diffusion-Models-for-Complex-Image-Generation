### **3-Month Quantum Diffusion Model Project Plan**

| Phase | Week | Topic | Detailed Objectives |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Foundational Research & Data Preprocessing** | **Week 1** | In-depth Paper Analysis & Data Preprocessing | - Thoroughly understand key concepts of the `arXiv:2311.15444` paper. <br> - Devise a preprocessing strategy for the F-MNIST dataset. <br> - Set up `Qiskit` or `PennyLane` environment and test a basic encoding circuit. |
| | **Week 2** | Noise Study & Performance Metrics | - Learn how to apply noise models in quantum simulation. <br> - Select and research key performance metrics (e.g., FID, IS) for the quantum diffusion model. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 2: Model Design, Implementation & Optimization** | **Week 3** | Model Architecture Design & Implementation (1) | - Design a **Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC)** optimized for F-MNIST. <br> - Implement the **forward diffusion process** circuit. |
| | **Week 4** | Model Architecture Design & Implementation (2) | - Design and implement a **Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)** to predict the **noise score**. <br> - Conduct initial tests to explore how circuit depth and width impact performance. |
| | **Week 5** | Hybrid Learning Loop Setup & Testing | - Integrate the classical optimizer with the quantum simulator to create a hybrid learning loop. <br> - Implement the chosen loss function and perform training tests on a small dataset. |
| | **Week 6** | F-MNIST Training (1) | - Start initial model training on grayscale F-MNIST images. <br> - Monitor the training process and debug any issues that arise. |
| | **Week 7** | F-MNIST Training (2) | - Optimize model parameters and perform hyperparameter tuning. <br> - Analyze changes in the quality of generated images as the model learns. |
| | **Week 8** | Model Enhancement & Error Mitigation | - Analyze model performance to identify bottlenecks. <br> - Attempt to integrate **error mitigation** techniques into the training process to improve performance in noisy environments. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 3: Evaluation & Final Reporting** | **Week 9** | Performance Evaluation & Qualitative Analysis | - Calculate quantitative metrics like **FID** and **IS** for generated images. <br> - Perform qualitative analysis by visualizing the latent space using methods like **t-SNE**. |
| | **Week 10** | Result Compilation & Visualization | - Compile all experimental data (loss curves, metrics, etc.). <br> - Create visual materials like image galleries and graphs for the report. |
| | **Week 11** | Research Report Draft | - Draft the research report including the introduction, methodology, results, and discussion. |
| | **Week 12** | Final Report & Presentation Preparation | - Finalize the research report based on mentor feedback. <br> - Prepare presentation slides for the project's conclusion. |
